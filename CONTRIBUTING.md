## Contributions to SuperTinyKernel (STK)

STK aims to remain freely usable and free from copyright or licensing constraints. Because the core kernel must remain unencumbered, we maintain a structured approach to external contributions.

### 1. Core Kernel & Source Code
We generally do not accept direct code patches for the core kernel from unsolicited contributors. This ensures long-term maintainability and legal clarity.

* **Proposals:** We welcome bug reports and design discussions. Please open an **Issue** first.
* **Process:** Once a proposal is approved, maintainers may implement the change independently or use a provided PR as a reference implementation to ensure it meets STK’s specific architectural standards.

### 2. Unit Tests & Examples
We are actively looking to expand our test suite and educational resources. We encourage PRs for:
* **Unit Tests:** Strengthening the reliability of the kernel.
* **Examples:** Demonstrating STK usage on various hardware or in specific use cases.

While these still require a brief Issue discussion for alignment, they are subject to a more streamlined review process than core kernel modifications.

### 3. Tooling & CI
Proposals related to **CI, GitHub Actions, or build tooling** that do not modify the kernel source are highly welcome. These are generally easier to approve but still require prior contact via an Issue or messaging channel.

### 4. How to Reach Us
Before submitting any PR, please ensure there is an associated Issue or that you have received prior approval. Unsolicited PRs for the core source code will be closed without a review.

* **Public:** Open an Issue on GitHub.
* **Private:** Email us at `stk@neutroncode.com` or reach out via social media private messaging.
