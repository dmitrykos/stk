## Contributions to SuperTinyKernel (STK)

STK aims to remain freely usable and free from copyright or licensing constraints. For this reason, we generally do not accept direct code patches from unsolicited external contributors.

There is a defined process by which changes may be incorporated into the project. This process is intentionally careful and may be more involved than is practical for small or incremental changes.

We welcome bug reports, design discussions, and change proposals. If you wish to suggest a modification, please begin by opening an Issue that clearly describes the problem or proposed improvement. Discussion and formal approval through the Issue tracker are required before any pull request is submitted.

Pull requests submitted without prior approval do not follow this policy and will be closed immediately, without review.

Once a proposal has been reviewed and explicitly approved, a pull request may be opened. A patch or reference implementation may be included as a proof of concept. Please note, however, that even approved changes may be implemented independently by the STK maintainers rather than merged verbatim. This helps ensure consistency, long-term maintainability, and the continued unencumbered status of the project.

Proposals related to CI, GitHub Actions, or other tooling that **do not modify the project's source code directly** are welcome and generally easier to approve. They still require prior contact with the maintainers, either via an Issue, e-mail, or another messaging channel.

You can also contact the maintainers privately by writing to **stk@neutroncode.com** or messaging in social media.
