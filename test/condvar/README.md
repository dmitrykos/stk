# ConditionVariable Test Suite

Test suite for `stk::sync::ConditionVariable`.  
Source: `test/condvar/test_condvar.cpp`

## API Summary

```cpp
#include <sync/stk_sync_cv.h>
#include <sync/stk_sync_mutex.h>
```

`ConditionVariable` follows the **Monitor pattern**: `Wait()` atomically releases the
associated `Mutex` and suspends the calling task. When the task wakes (via signal or
timeout or cancellation) the `Mutex` is re-acquired before `Wait()` returns. All operations must be
performed with the mutex held by the caller, except `NotifyOne()` and `NotifyAll()`
which are ISR-safe.

Requires kernel mode: `KERNEL_DYNAMIC | KERNEL_SYNC`.

```cpp
// Construction — both primitives are globals, reconstructed per test via placement-new
stk::sync::Mutex             g_Mtx;
stk::sync::ConditionVariable g_Cond;
```

| Method | Signature | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `WaitEx` | `EWaitResult WaitEx(IMutex &mutex, Timeout timeout = WAIT_INFINITE)` | Same as `Wait()`, but preserves the full outcome: `WAIT_RESULT_SIGNAL` (notified), `WAIT_RESULT_TIMEOUT` (timeout expired, or `NO_WAIT`), `WAIT_RESULT_CANCELED` (wait cancelled via `IKernel::CancelTaskWait()` or `SleepCancel()`). `mutex` is re-acquired in all three cases. ISR-safe only with `NO_WAIT`. |
| `Wait` | `bool Wait(IMutex &mutex, Timeout timeout = WAIT_INFINITE)` | Atomically releases `mutex` and blocks the calling task. Re-acquires `mutex` before returning, whatever ended the wait. Returns `true` if signaled, `false` otherwise (timeout, cancellation, or `NO_WAIT`); use `WaitEx()` to tell these apart. Returns `false` immediately without blocking if `timeout == NO_WAIT`. ISR-unsafe unless `timeout == NO_WAIT`. |
| `NotifyOne` | `void NotifyOne()` | Wakes one waiting task in FIFO arrival order. No-op if no tasks are waiting. ISR-safe. |
| `NotifyAll` | `void NotifyAll()` | Wakes all waiting tasks simultaneously. No-op if no tasks are waiting. ISR-safe. |
| `~ConditionVariable` | (destructor) | Asserts `m_wait_list.IsEmpty()` in debug builds. Destroying a CV with active waiters is a logic error. |

**Canonical usage pattern** (spurious-wakeup-safe):

```cpp
// Consumer
g_Mtx.Lock();
while (!condition_met)
    g_Cond.Wait(g_Mtx, WAIT_INFINITE);
// ... consume shared state ...
g_Mtx.Unlock();

// Producer
g_Mtx.Lock();
condition_met = true;
g_Cond.NotifyOne();
g_Mtx.Unlock();
```

**Key invariants:**

- `Wait()` must be called with the mutex **locked** by the calling task.
- The mutex is released **atomically** with task suspension — no window exists where
  the mutex is held and the task is not yet blocked.
- The mutex is always re-acquired before `Wait()` returns, on the signaled, timeout and
  cancelled paths.
- `Wait(mutex, NO_WAIT)` returns `false` immediately; the implementation short-circuits
  before calling `StartWaiting()`.
- A cancelled wait (`WAIT_RESULT_CANCELED`) is distinct from a timeout, re-acquires the
  mutex before `WaitEx()` returns, and leaves no stale entry in the wait list.
- Mutex re-acquisition is not cancelable: `Mutex::Lock()` absorbs a cancel and retries.
  If a notification reaches a waiter before a cancel does, the signal wins
  (`WAIT_RESULT_SIGNAL`) and the cancel, which then lands while the waiter re-locks the
  mutex, is a no-op.
- A `ConditionVariable` keeps no signaled state: a notification with no waiter is lost,
  and a cancel never consumes one.
- Destroying a `ConditionVariable` while tasks are still waiting is a logic error;
  an assertion fires in debug builds.

## Test Configuration

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `_STK_CV_TEST_TASKS_MAX` | `5` | Total tasks per test run |
| `_STK_CV_TEST_TIMEOUT` | `300` ticks | Blocking timeout for `Wait()` calls that must succeed |
| `_STK_CV_TEST_SHORT_SLEEP` | `10` ticks | Sleep used to pace task sequencing |
| `_STK_CV_TEST_LONG_SLEEP` | `100` ticks | Sleep used by the verifier task to wait for workers |
| `_STK_CV_STACK_SIZE` | `128` (M0) / `256` (others) | Per-task stack size in `size_t` words |

Both `g_TestMutex` and `g_TestCond` are **reconstructed in-place** via placement-new
inside `ResetTestState()` before each test, ensuring no wait-list or ownership state
leaks between runs.

The cancellation tests (9–19) additionally use a small amount of shared state, reset by
`ResetTestState()`:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `g_Victim` / `g_VictimTid` | Task (and its `TId`) whose wait is cancelled; published by task 1 right before it blocks |
| `g_VictimResult[2]` | `EWaitResult` observed by task 1 / task 2 (`-100` = not set) |
| `g_VictimElapsed[2]` | Milliseconds spent inside `WaitEx()` by task 1 / task 2 |
| `g_VictimOwnsMutex[2]` | `1` if task 1 / task 2 owned `g_TestMutex` when `WaitEx()` returned |
| `g_VictimSleepElapsed` | Milliseconds task 1 spends in a `Sleep(60)` after its wait was cancelled |
| `g_CancelParam` | Scenario selector (see below); a global rather than a constructor argument because tasks 0–2 are `static` and would keep the value of the first case |

The helper `CancelVictim(use_sleep_cancel)` cancels the victim either with
`g_Kernel.CancelTaskWait(g_Victim)` or with `stk::SleepCancel(g_VictimTid)`.

## Platform Notes

On **Cortex-M0** (`__ARM_ARCH_6M__`) the device has insufficient RAM to link all nine
distinct task class templates simultaneously. Tests 1–7 and the cancellation tests 9–19
are skipped on M0 and only `StressTest` (test 8) runs. `StressTest` uses a single task
class template instantiated five times, which fits within the available memory.
`CancelWaitTask` adds one more template (shared by all eleven cancellation tests) to the
static footprint.

Stack sizes differ between platforms because the `sync::Mutex` + `ConditionVariable` +
`IKernelService::StartWaiting()` call chain is deeper than a bare `SpinLock` acquire:

| Platform | `_STK_CV_STACK_SIZE` |
|----------|----------------------|
| Cortex-M0 (`__ARM_ARCH_6M__`) | `128` words |
| All others | `256` words |

## Tests

### Test 1 — `NotifyOneWakes`
**Tasks:** 0–4 (all 5) &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `iterations = 20`

Task 0 is the producer; tasks 1–4 are consumers. All four consumers block on
`Wait(WAIT_INFINITE)`. The producer calls `NotifyOne()` 20 times, pacing each call
with `Delay(1)` so each notification has time to land on exactly one blocked waiter
before the next fires. Each successful wake increments `g_SharedCounter`.

**Pass condition:** `counter == 20`

---

### Test 2 — `NotifyAllWakes`
**Tasks:** 0–4 (all 5)

All four consumers (tasks 1–4) block on `Wait(_STK_CV_TEST_TIMEOUT)`. After
`_STK_CV_TEST_SHORT_SLEEP` ticks the producer (task 0) calls `NotifyAll()` once.
Every consumer must be released by that single call.

**Pass condition:** `counter == 4`

---

### Test 3 — `TimeoutExpires`
**Tasks:** 0–2 only

Task 1 calls `Wait(50)` with no producer present; the call must return `false` and
the measured elapsed time must fall within `[45, 65]` ms. Task 2 then blocks with
a generous timeout; the producer (task 0) fires `NotifyOne()` at tick 130 to wake it.
Verifies both the timeout return value and that the condition variable remains usable
after a timeout has occurred.

**Pass condition:** `counter == 2`
(1 = timeout fired correctly in bounds; 2 = subsequent `NotifyOne()` still woke task 2)

---

### Test 4 — `MutexReacquired`
**Tasks:** 0–2 only

Directly verifies the Monitor pattern atomicity guarantee on both wakeup paths:

- **Signaled path** (task 1): holds mutex, calls `Wait(TIMEOUT)`; producer (task 0)
  acquires the mutex while task 1 is suspended — proving it was released — increments
  the counter, then calls `NotifyOne()`. Task 1 resumes and calls `Unlock()`; if the
  mutex was not re-acquired the ownership assert would fire.
- **Timeout path** (task 2): calls `Wait(50)` with no notification; on timeout calls
  `Unlock()` — same ownership assert check on the timeout path.

**Pass condition:** `counter == 3`
(1 = mutex was free during `Wait()`; 2 = signaled path re-acquired; 3 = timeout path re-acquired)

---

### Test 5 — `PredicateLoop`
**Tasks:** 0–4 (all 5)

Exercises the canonical spurious-wakeup-safe `while (!cond) Wait()` pattern. Each
consumer (tasks 1–4) loops: `while (g_SharedCounter < m_task_id) Wait()`. The producer
increments `g_SharedCounter` and calls `NotifyOne()` once per consumer, paced with
`Delay(1)`. Consumers that wake and find the predicate unsatisfied re-enter `Wait()`,
correctly tolerating both spurious wakeups and out-of-order delivery.

**Pass condition:** `counter == 4` (all four consumers exited their predicate loops)

---

### Test 6 — `NotifyOneOrder`
**Tasks:** 0–4 (all 5)

Verifies FIFO wake ordering. Tasks 1–4 block in scheduling order (1, 2, 3, 4). The
producer calls `NotifyOne()` four times with `Delay(1)` between calls. Each woken
consumer records its `m_task_id` into `g_AcquisitionOrder[g_OrderIndex++]`. After all
consumers have been woken, the verifier checks that the recorded IDs are strictly
ascending.

**Pass condition:** `order == [1,2,3,4]` and `counter == 4`

---

### Test 7 — `NoWaitTimeout`
**Tasks:** 0–2 only

Verifies the `NO_WAIT` fast-path in `ConditionVariable::Wait()`. Task 1 calls
`Wait(g_TestMutex, NO_WAIT)`; per the implementation this returns `false` immediately
without calling `StartWaiting()`. Elapsed time must be less than
`_STK_CV_TEST_SHORT_SLEEP`. Task 2 then performs a normal blocking `Wait()` which the
producer wakes correctly, confirming the condition variable is fully functional after
a `NO_WAIT` call.

**Pass condition:** `counter == 2`
(1 = `NO_WAIT` returned `false` immediately; 2 = subsequent blocking `Wait()` woken correctly)

---

### Test 8 — `StressTest`
**Tasks:** 0–4 (all 5) — **runs on all platforms including Cortex-M0** &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `iterations = 100`

All five tasks alternate producer and consumer roles each iteration. Even iterations
(0, 2, 4, …): acquire mutex, increment `g_SharedCounter`, call `NotifyOne()`, release.
Odd iterations (1, 3, 5, …): acquire mutex, call `Wait(_STK_CV_TEST_SHORT_SLEEP)`,
release. Consumer `Wait()` calls may time out under contention — this is expected and
does not count as a failure. Task 4 uses a `g_InstancesDone` completion barrier to
ensure all five tasks finish before the result is checked.

Minimum guaranteed count: producer iterations only = `5 × ⌈100/2⌉` = `5 × 50 = 250`.

**Pass condition:** `counter >= 250`

---

### Cancellation tests (Tests 9–19)

Tests 9–19 verify that a wait on a `ConditionVariable` can be cancelled and that nothing
is left behind: no stale wait entry, and the mutex always back in the victim's hands. All
use the same task class (`CancelWaitTask`) and **tasks 0–2 only** (`"CancelWait*"` names
are excluded from the extended task set). The cancel is issued by task 0 after
`Sleep(60)`; task 1 is the *victim* that locks the mutex and blocks in `WaitEx()` after
`_STK_CV_TEST_SHORT_SLEEP` ticks; task 2 is a second waiter used only by the two-waiters
tests. Tests 9–14 cancel with `IKernel::CancelTaskWait()`; tests 15–19 repeat the key
scenarios with `stk::SleepCancel()`. The scenario is selected by `param` (`1..6`);
adding `100` selects `SleepCancel`. In every scenario the victim must own the mutex when
`WaitEx()` returns, regardless of how the wait ended.

`StressTest` keeps the number 8 but runs last in `main()`, after the cancellation tests.

> **Safety net:** if a cancel does not work, the victim would stay blocked forever and the
> kernel would never stop. On failure task 0 therefore calls `NotifyAll()` twice to release
> any stuck waiter, so a broken cancel is reported as a test failure rather than a hang.

> **Kernel requirement:** tests 15–19 depend on `SleepCancel()` also cancelling a wait on a
> sync object (`OnTaskSleepCancel()` routes through `WaitObject::Cancel()`). Against a kernel
> where `SleepCancel()` only wakes the task, they fail by design: that is the stale wait
> entry regression they exist to catch.

---

### Test 9 — `CancelWait_Infinite`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `1` &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Runs on M0: no**

Task 1 locks the mutex and calls `WaitEx(WAIT_INFINITE)` at about tick 10. Task 0 cancels
it at about tick 60 via `CancelTaskWait()` and waits `2 × _STK_CV_TEST_SHORT_SLEEP` for
the victim to record its result.

**Pass condition:** `result == WAIT_RESULT_CANCELED`, elapsed in `[35, 75]` ms, victim owns the mutex

---

### Test 10 — `CancelWait_NotTimeout`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `2`

Same as test 9 but task 1 waits with a finite 300-tick timeout. Verifies that a cancel is
reported as `WAIT_RESULT_CANCELED`, not `WAIT_RESULT_TIMEOUT`, and that the wait really
ends early instead of running to its deadline.

**Pass condition:** `result == WAIT_RESULT_CANCELED`, elapsed `< 150` ms, victim owns the mutex

---

### Test 11 — `CancelWait_NoStaleWaiter`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `3`

After the cancel, task 1 releases the mutex and starts a `Sleep(60)`, which it measures.
Task 0 then calls `NotifyAll()` with nobody waiting. A condition variable keeps no state,
so there is nothing to poll afterwards; instead, a ghost wait entry left behind by the
cancel would be woken by that notification and cut the victim's sleep short.

**Pass condition:** `result == WAIT_RESULT_CANCELED`, victim owns the mutex, victim sleep `>= 55` ms

---

### Test 12 — `CancelWait_MutexHeld`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `4`

Verifies that a cancelled waiter still goes through mutex re-acquisition. Task 0 locks the
mutex (free, because the victim released it inside `WaitEx()`), cancels the victim, then
sleeps `_STK_CV_TEST_SHORT_SLEEP` ticks while still holding it. The victim has been woken
as cancelled but must stay blocked re-acquiring the mutex: its result is still unset and
`GetOwner()` still names task 0. Task 0 then calls `Unlock()`, which hands the mutex over
to the victim.

**Pass condition:** victim still blocked while task 0 held the mutex, `GetOwner()` was task 0,
then `result == WAIT_RESULT_CANCELED` and victim owns the mutex

---

### Test 13 — `CancelWait_TwoWaiters`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `5`

Task 1 blocks first, task 2 blocks behind it (`Sleep(20)` before locking and calling
`WaitEx(WAIT_INFINITE)`). Task 0 cancels only task 1, then locks the mutex and calls
`NotifyOne()`. The notification must reach task 2, which proves the wait list stayed
intact after the removal of its first entry and that no ghost of task 1 absorbed it.

**Pass condition:** task 1 `WAIT_RESULT_CANCELED`, task 2 `WAIT_RESULT_SIGNAL`, both own the mutex on return

---

### Test 14 — `CancelWait_SignalWins`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `6`

Task 0 locks the mutex, calls `NotifyOne()` and immediately cancels the victim, then
unlocks. The victim is already notified and unlinked from the wait list when the cancel
arrives; it is only blocked re-locking the mutex held by task 0. The cancel must be
absorbed (`Mutex::Lock()` is not cancelable) and the result must stay `WAIT_RESULT_SIGNAL`.

**Pass condition:** `result == WAIT_RESULT_SIGNAL` and victim owns the mutex

---

### Test 15 — `CancelWait_SleepCancel`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `101`

Test 9 using `stk::SleepCancel(tid)` instead of `CancelTaskWait()`.

**Pass condition:** same as test 9

---

### Test 16 — `CancelWait_SleepCancelNoStale`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `103`

Test 11 using `SleepCancel()`. This is the primary regression test for the
`OnTaskSleepCancel()` fix: without it the `WaitObject` stays linked in the condition
variable's wait list after the task is woken.

**Pass condition:** same as test 11

---

### Test 17 — `CancelWait_SleepCancelMutex`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `104`

Test 12 using `SleepCancel()`.

**Pass condition:** same as test 12

---

### Test 18 — `CancelWait_SleepCancelTwo`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `105`

Test 13 using `SleepCancel()`.

**Pass condition:** same as test 13

---

### Test 19 — `CancelWait_SleepCancelSignal`
**Tasks:** 0–2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Param:** `106`

Test 14 using `SleepCancel()`. The cancel hits a task that is no longer waiting on the
condition variable but is blocked on the mutex, so this also checks that the cancel is
absorbed there without disturbing the already-delivered notification.

**Pass condition:** same as test 14
